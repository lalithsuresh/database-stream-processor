First, build the DBSP docker container following the instructions
in the `/deploy` folder.

Next, to try this example, run the following docker command
from this directory. This brings up the DBSP docker container
and mounts this directory to be available within the docker
container's `/examples` folder:

```
docker run --name dbsp -p 8081:8080 -v `pwd`:/examples -itd dbspmanager
```

Now go to `localhost:8081` on your browser and start a pipeline
with the `combiner.sql` and the `config.yml` files in this directory.

Once the pipeline runs, you should see an output file named `matches.csv`
be created in this directory with the message `Hello world!,1` (1 indicating
that this tuple was added to the output collection).
